# Using the code above, implement the relevant methods and dunder methods which will output the results below.
# Hint : When adding 2 currencies which donâ€™t share the same label you should raise an error.

# >>> str(c1)
# '5 dollars'
# >>> int(c1)
# 5
# >>> repr(c1)
# '5 dollars'
# >>> c1 + 5
# 10
# >>> c1 + c2
# 15
# >>> c1 
# 5 dollars
# >>> c1 += 5
# >>> c1
# 10 dollars
# >>> c1 += c2
# >>> c1
# 20 dollars
# >>> c1 + c3
# TypeError: Cannot add between Currency type <dollar> and <shekel>


# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Import
# Instructions
# In a file named func.py create a function that adds 2 number, and prints the result
# In a file namedexercise_one.py import and the function
# Hint: You can use the the following syntaxes:
# import module_name 
# OR 
# from module_name import function_name 
# OR 
# from module_name import function_name as fn 
# OR
# import module_name as mn

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String Module
# Instructions
# Generate random String of length 5
# Note: String must be the combination of the UPPER case and lower case letters only. No numbers and a special symbol.
# Hint: use the string module


# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Current Date
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the current date.
# Hint : Use the datetime module.


# Exercise 5 : Amount Of Time Left Until January 1st
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.
# (Example: the 1st of January is in 10 days and 10:34:01hours).


# Exercise 6 : Birthday And Minutes
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a birthdate as an argument (in the format of your choice), then displays a message stating how many minutes the user lived in his life.


# Exercise 7 : Faker Module
# Instructions
# Install the faker module, and take a look at the documentation and learn how to properly implement faker in your code.
# Create an empty list called users. Tip: It should be a list of dictionaries.
# Create a function that adds new dictionaries to the users list. Each user has the following keys: name, adress, langage_code. Use faker to populate them with fake data.
